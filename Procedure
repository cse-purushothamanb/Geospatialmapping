Procedure for representing Road, Buildings and water bodies on a Raster image is as follows:

Step 01: Before starting of the project, lets download tiles in the form of TIFF type. To download the tiles, we need to visit the Bhuvan portal on https://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/

Step 02: By clicking on the Bhuvan 2D icon and visiting the Bhuvan Store we can download the tiles of " Resourcesat-1/Resourcesat-2:LISS III Ortho satellite "
         Refer fig 01 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/4c17d7da-97ce-4fbb-a1a1-ebfceadcc2e0)

Step 03: Downloading tiles by specifying Min Latitude, Min Longitude, Max Latitude and Max Longitude in the Boundary box.
         The parameters for the Bangalore region are as follows:
         a.Min Latitude = 12.5
         b.Min Longitude = 77
         c.Max Latitude = 13.5
         d.Max Longitude = 78
         By clicking the select button, the Bangalore region will be highlighted with a red bordered region of 16 tiles.
         But, lets download the only 6 tiles which is around the Bangalore region. The view of tiles is shown in the given image below.
         Refer fig 02 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/84244fe4-be05-49d6-a258-4d9edc21657e)

Step 04: After downloading each tile one by one, lets display the spectral view of each tile using Erdas Imagine 2014 through the following steps:
         Raster -> Spectral -> Layer Stack -> Select the input file where the TIFF files are available for the first tile and add the files one by one->Select the output file where the spectral image has to be saved with img extension.
         Spectral image of the first tile:
         Refer fig 03 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/b7d51326-a9a3-4c9a-bb60-8275d4d44a26)

Step 05: Spectral image of second tile:
         Refer fig 04 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/80c95b6e-b876-472b-8361-665473038ec4)

Step 06: Spectral image of the third tile:
         Refer fig 05 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/864804ba-65c0-410f-aab6-f141c06cbc0c)

Step 07: Spectral image of the fourth tile:
         Refer fig 06 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/a8f54b9e-96a3-4b2a-82ce-5f6ca1313ebf)

Step 08: Spectral image of the fifth tile:
         Refer fig 07 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/a5ae9856-b50d-4b61-8a2b-011bb495cb58)

Step 09: Spectral image of the sixth tile:
         Refer fig 08 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/856a6450-e910-4c37-9b3f-68f47dab16ba)

Step 10: After spectral view of all the images we need to mosaic the images for the raster view.
                  a. Add all the spectral image in the mosaic geometry.
                    Refer fig 09 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/aab7578b-d144-4045-bbaf-814ad3fb69d0)

                  b. After mosaicking of the spectral images, the Raster view is been displayed:
                    Refer fig 10 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/6d783dcc-aeb8-49a4-8e06-6c6d6ef1be3a) 

Step 11: We can also view the vector image of the Bangalore region by downloading the shape file from KGis web portal:
         Refer fig 11 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/7c316436-b1b9-462b-80a3-c0c34092c1ff)

Step 12: The clipped image is shown below:
         Refer fig 12 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/62e13d93-ab58-455a-8527-88089a14de94)

Step 13: Then by using the polygon attribute we can represent the water body as shown below:
         Refer fig 13 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/0172a0e3-1e7b-4d05-9f9a-4a7fe1095eb4)

Step 14: The road view is been displayed by using line attribute:
          Refer fig 14 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/5bcbc18b-f624-450e-b850-826d8113fc75)

Step 15: Finally the Building, Road and water bodies are viewed in the following form:
          Refer fig 15 in README.md file (https://github.com/cse-purushothamanb/Project-1/assets/143436614/ddfc7207-13e9-4c5e-989f-4cc2b50f4bc9)
